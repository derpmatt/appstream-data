  C: Github Desktop
Summary:
  C: GitHub Desktop is an open source Electron-based GitHub app. It is written in TypeScript and uses React. It provides simple collaboration from your desktop.
Description:
  C: >-
    <p>We aim to make common workflows so simple that beginner and experienced developers alike are productive in working with Git and GitHub. Users of all experience levels will continue to benefit from GitHub Desktopâ€™s features, but when we have to choose between workflows for advanced Git users and workflows for beginner Git users, we prioritize beginners. GitHub Desktop should be a helpful tool for beginner developers, but it is not explicitly a teaching tool. It is fundamentally to help you get your work done faster and more effectively, in a way that is consistent with and encourages best practices. It is intended primarily to extend the features of GitHub, not to be an agnostic Git client or replicate the feature set of github.com.</p>
    <p>This package is the shiftkey fork for Linux</p>
